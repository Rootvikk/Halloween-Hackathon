        <section><h2 class="title"> Origins of Halloween </h2></section>
        <p>Halloween, celebrated on October 31st, originated from the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, which marked the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter. The Celts believed the boundary between the living and the dead blurred on this night, allowing spirits to roam. To protect themselves, people lit bonfires and wore animal skin costumes. As Christianity spread, the festival evolved into All Hallows' Eve, which later became Halloween. By the 19th century, Irish immigrants brought Halloween customs to America, introducing practices like trick-or-treating. Today, Halloween is a festive celebration blending ancient traditions with modern festivities, from haunted houses to costume parties, preserving its rich history.</p>

        <p>The tradition of wearing costumes on Halloween dates back to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, where people wore animal skin costumes to protect themselves from roaming spirits. As Halloween evolved, especially with the influence of Christianity, costumes became a form of playful expression. In the 19th century, Irish immigrants popularized the custom in America, turning it into a community-centered celebration. Over time, costumes shifted from being a form of protection to a fun and creative way to celebrate the holiday. Today, Halloween costumes range from spooky to whimsical, reflecting trends, pop culture, and creativity. The tradition allows everyone to explore different identities, whether through traditional, modern, or funny costumes.
